Hello everyone!

Welcome to my first ever blog, I want to say a massive thanks to toxic
for help getting this all working. In this post I will be going though
why I've temporarily left the staff team...

I think It was 3 months ago I joined when the old owner was there, when
toxic took over for him I started talking to him for a bit then it got
more like daily chats then I entered into the staff team. As everyone
I started as a Moderator there and worked my way up to about Staff Manager,
then I shown Toxic and Conner my dev work and they took me on as a trial developer!

When I got it I was really excited to get started, some of the features I brought out were
• 12 Hour Voting
• Massive Server Updates
• Updated Every Log To Embeds
+ Much More...

If you follow my Twitter you have probably seen some stuff happening at the moment with family
that was the main reason I left there for a little rest for a while, don't get mr wrong I loved
working there everyday was a new adventure for me and it didn't stop... Overall Conner and Toxic are
the best Developers on Discord I know and some of the nicest people you could meet on here ❤️

I'm sure everyone knows where I'm going now but now what does this mean for IBL?
Well I can hopefully start doing some development side here and there but I will be definitely 
helping in the server where I can, helping with the servers and maintenance on that end
and just being here for anyone... As toxic said I don't really want to get loads of spams
but if you would like to chat about this message me I'm always up for a chat and you may learn
something new about me?

Thanks Maxim
- (InfinityBotList Team)
