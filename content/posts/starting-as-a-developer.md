Heya Guys,
So have you ever wanted to become a developer but don't know where to start?
Well on this blog I will tell you how I started out as a developer, what 
courses I used getting started and some little tips on how to pick the right language
for you!

## My Backstory!

My name is Maxim King, I'm a backend developer and have been studying computer studies
for on 3 years now. I started our developing my first discord bot (Strider) a year ago, there
was two main reasons I made it. First was because every bot was behind a pay wall and I wanted
to make something peolle would enjoy and I was fed up of paying monthly for basic bots.
So that day I probably watched about 10 videos, and started making Strider my first ever discord bot
that's now on over 500 servers with 200K+ users! What to learn how I got from Never touched the computer
to having a discord bot in over 500 servers? Look at the getting started bit!!
