Heya Guys,
So have you ever wanted to become a developer but don't know where to start?
Well on this blog I will tell you how I started out as a developer, what 
courses I used getting started and some little tips on how to pick the right language
for you!

## My Backstory!

My name is Maxim King, I'm a backend developer and have been studying computer studies
for on 3 years now. I started our developing my first discord bot (Strider) a year ago, there
was two main reasons I made it. First was because every bot was behind a pay wall and I wanted
to make something peolle would enjoy and I was fed up of paying monthly for basic bots.
So that day I probably watched about 10 videos, and started making Strider my first ever discord bot
that's now on over 500 servers with 200K+ users! What to learn how I got from Never touched the computer
to having a discord bot in over 500 servers? Look at the getting started bit!!

## Getting Started!

I would first suggest you start looking at any basic Open Source bot, it's good to get a feel for the code
before diving in head first, if you can check one out see what something does and then try and change it you've just
learnt something new.. Keep experimenting with the code and once you feel like you have any understanding of what does
what your good to go! Really this step isn't necessary but I would definitely 100% recommend it as it really helps
you get started!
